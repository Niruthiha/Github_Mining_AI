Ref: https://www.ibm.com/able/toolkit/verify/automated\n- Open Notebook UI on Chrome browser. Add some cells with code.\n- Run the tool and we can see the above `Violation`s reported.\n\nHere is the screenshot of the UI scanned for the attached report:\n![Image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/895eebec-51ad-43cd-93bb-99c4a8193b68)\n\n## Expected behavior\n\nMenu is accessible using a keyboard `Tab` key\nReference on how to fix this issue can be found in these links:\n[Where possible, achieve the desired tab order by adjusting the DOM, rather than overriding the tabindex](https://www.ibm.com/able/toolkit/develop/keyboard/#tab-order)\n[Use standard HTML elements where possible, using CSS to alter appearance not behavior](https://www.ibm.com/able/toolkit/develop/keyboard/#standard-html)\n[Be familiar with established keyboard conventions](https://www.ibm.com/able/toolkit/develop/keyboard/#keyboard-conventions)\n[Implement keyboard operation for custom elements](https://www.ibm.com/able/toolkit/develop/keyboard/#custom-elements)\n[Follow core considerations in reducing effort](https://www.ibm.com/able/toolkit/develop/overview#reducing-effort)\n[Unit test - confirm component keyboard interaction](https://www.ibm.com/able/toolkit/develop/overview#confirm-keyboard-interaction)",

We are now using 7.2.2 version for Notebook. \n\nI tried on the https://jupyter.org/try-jupyter/notebooks/?path=notebooks/Intro.ipynb and now I know what happened here. \n\nThe automated tool was asking to manually verify that the focus is visible. And when I did a manual testing, I did not notice the focus being set because the background color for our UI is same as the active css color specified for the menu item(you can see this in the screenshot I provided in the description). \nAlso, I think I expected a border highlight for the focus like other UI components do. Hence the confusion. \nThe background on the actual \"try\" notebook UI is \"white\" so focus color is visible. \n\n<img width=\"324\" alt=\"Image\" src=\"https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/0943515d-5b74-4f32-be4a-faa6b56d9f26\" />\n \nThere is also another suggestion that the tool provides to add a border/outline on focus. \n<img width=\"621\" alt=\"Image\" src=\"https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/fe52c215-40ef-4424-971a-2ff3521d1199\" />\n\nBut I think technically it is either a change in background color or the border as per the doc: https://www.w3.org/WAI/WCAG22/Techniques/client-side-script/SCR31 \nSo what notebook is doing right now should suffice. \n\nI think I will need to see we can override the focus color to be more evident on our side or may be not change the background color. Will update here if I need help. \n\n"

However, after upgrading, I'm already seeing key pieces missing. Therefore I'm opening this issue to attempt to track issues as I see them.\r\n\r\n### Keyboard shortcuts\r\n\r\n- Some of the shortcuts from the Collapsible Headings extension have been added - thank you! However, the ability to hold `shift` whilst pressing `right-arrow` has been lost -- this ought to select from the current cell to the end of the section\r\n- ctrl-shift-q is shown in the menu as halting and closing the current notebook, which worked in classic, but it doesn't actually do anything for me (latest MacOS / Chrome)\r\n- `o` no longer toggles showing/hiding the output of a cell, and I don't see any way to add this\r\n- I can't see a way to add a keyboard shortcut for \"run all above current cell\" (or ditto for below cell)\r\n- In general, there does not seem to be a way, at least in the GUI, to add keyboard shortcuts to all menu items.\r\n\r\n### Proposal\r\n\r\nIdeally, everything that can be achieved with the mouse would be surfaced as an element that could be tied to a keyboard shortcut via the GUI.\r\n",

Details TBD.\r\n\r\nI hope that nb 6 will remain in maintenance mode until enthusiastic nb 6 users have agreed that nb 7 has reached the high bar that v6 achieved! :D\r\n"

In particular, cmd-f no longer brings up the browser Find functionality, but instead brings up Lab's. However the Lab functionality does not search in cell outputs, so is not a substitute\r\n- The undo buffer is no longer per-cell, so hitting cmd-z now (surprisingly, to me) changes cells other than the current one\r\n- When switching Windows to focus on Jupyter, the keyboard controls are not on the cells, but on the window itself. Therefore none of the jupyter shortcuts work, and arrow keys scroll the window instead of selecting cells.\r\n"

Include screenshots if possible-->\r\n\r\n## Reproduce\r\n\r\nIn jupyter notebook (codemirror? Jupyter has too many poorly delineated components):\r\n\r\n<!--Describe step-by-step instructions to reproduce the behavior-->\r\n\r\n1. Set the indentation to tabs:  \r\n![image](https://github.com/jupyter/notebook/assets/1401239/f240252d-edf9-44f6-a048-23b08e947bbe)\r\n2. Select a block of code.\r\n3. Hit Tab\r\n4. You get spaces: \r\n![image](https://github.com/jupyter/notebook/assets/1401239/0dec7954-0087-4bde-a7ba-660512984631)\r\n\r\n\r\n## Expected behavior\r\n\r\nIf you have the editor set to tab mode (the correct way to indent things), I'd expect the block indentation operation to insert tabs.\r\n\r\nAdditionally, Notebook 7 seems to no longer have visible tab characters, whereas they are shown in 6 and/or \"nbclassic\". I'd call that a regression.\r\n\r\n## Context\r\n\r\n- Operating System and version: Server: Ubuntu 22.04. Client: Windows 10\r\n- Browser and version: Vivaldi 6.1.3035.302 (Stable channel) (64-bit) \r\n<!-- Please note the Notebook version you are working with. You can find this in the Help -> About Jupyter Notebook menu option or by running `jupyter --version` from your terminal -->\r\n- Jupyter Notebook version: 7.0.3\r\n\r\nI don't think the rest of the template is relevant, since this seems to be a logic error rather then a bug in the sense of the code doing something it's not intended to do. \r\n",

I am not sure what exactly you are suggesting here though, as the current state is black for matches and yellow for current highlight.\n\n> jupyter's new search doesn't even highlight the damn text i'm looking for.\n\nIs it in an output of a cell? If so then you need to tick \"Search in Cell Outputs\":\n\n![Image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/1aedfe80-9145-4cbb-b531-d0ce9b5286b3)\n\nSee:\n- https://github.com/jupyterlab/jupyterlab/issues/15445\n- https://github.com/jupyterlab/jupyterlab/issues/15966\n\n> i quit using lab because the search made it unusuable\n\nI understand, I am frustrated by the default not searching in outputs. I spent too much of my free time in evenings and quite a few days paid by downstream users to fix many of the search issues but this one has not been resolved yet. I wish there were resources dedicated to fixing issues like that. I am frustrated here too.\n\n>  i know the software is free and i'm trying really hard not to outright complain here, but WHY is that search feature now in notebook?\n\nTo be frank you are complaining in a wrong repo (`jupyter-client`), I will move this to `notebook`. But to your question, Notebook 7 is based of JupyterLab components. If you wish to use the old interface or the native browser search you have two options:\n- use nbclassic/notebook 6.5.x (the old interface)\n- read the documentation for search/replace in Notebook 7 https://jupyter-notebook.readthedocs.io/en/stable/notebook.html#searching\n"

There are many more people in the Jupyter community that engage on that channel.\r\n\r\nNOTE:\r\nJupyter Notebook 6.x development is in maintenance-only mode. Bugs found in Notebook 6.x and that don't reproduce in Notebook 7.x may not get fixed.\r\n\r\nWork in this repository is focused on Jupyter Notebook 7.x, the former RetroLab project. The code base for Notebook 7.x is very different than Notebook 6.x. If you can, please try reproducing Notebook 6.x bugs with Notebook 7.x using the main branch of this repository.\r\n\r\nWe recommend that you check out JupyterLab (https://github.com/jupyterlab/jupyterlab), Jupyter's next generation Notebook interface.\r\n\r\nHere, we're looking for specific bugs in the Jupyter Notebook codebase. If you think you've identified such a bug, you can continue opening your issue here.

Randomly, all the cells after the last executed cell disappear, leaving the page blank (white) in that section. The issue if fixed if I re-open the notebook, but I sometimes face it again further down below.\n\n",

Open a notebook with a large number of cells (> 5?) and execute cells\n2. Work for 10-15 minutes, scroll up and down\n3. Screen is blank as shown in original comment.\n## Expected behavior\n\nCells should always display.\n\n## Context\n\n\n- Operating System and version: MacOS Sequoia 15.1\n- Browser and version: \n   -

I have confirmed that rolling my extension back to 2024.11.0 eliminates the issue.  \n\nPlease forgive me if I am missing something obvious.  \n\nI really appreciate any help you can provide.\n\nThanks,\n\n\n\nanyio                     4.9.0\nargon2-cffi               23.1.0\nargon2-cffi-bindings      21.2.0\narrow                     1.3.0\nasttokens                 3.0.0\nasync-lru                 2.0.5\nattrs                     25.3.0\nbabel                     2.17.0\nbeautifulsoup4            4.13.3\nbleach                    6.2.0\ncertifi                   2025.1.31\ncffi                      1.17.1\ncharset-normalizer        3.4.1\ncolorama                  0.4.6\ncomm                      0.2.2\ndebugpy                   1.8.13\ndecorator                 5.2.1\ndefusedxml                0.7.1\nexceptiongroup            1.2.2\nexecuting                 2.2.0\nfastjsonschema            2.21.1\nfqdn                      1.5.1\nh11                       0.14.0\nhttpcore                  1.0.7\nhttpx                     0.28.1\nidna                      3.10\nipykernel                 6.29.5\nipython                   8.34.0\nipywidgets                8.1.5\nisoduration               20.11.0\njedi                      0.19.2\nJinja2                    3.1.6\njson5                     0.10.0\njsonpointer               3.0.0\njsonschema                4.23.0\njsonschema-specifications 2024.10.1\njupyter                   1.1.1\njupyter_client            8.6.3\njupyter-console           6.6.3\njupyter_core              5.7.2\njupyter-events            0.12.0\njupyter-lsp               2.2.5\njupyter_server            2.15.0\njupyter_server_terminals  0.5.3\njupyterlab                4.3.6\njupyterlab_pygments       0.3.0\njupyterlab_server         2.27.3\njupyterlab_widgets        3.0.13\nMarkupSafe                3.0.2\nmatplotlib-inline         0.1.7\nmistune                   3.1.2\nnbclient                  0.10.2\nnbconvert                 7.16.6\nnbformat                  5.10.4\nnest-asyncio              1.6.0\nnotebook                  7.3.3\nnotebook_shim             0.2.4\noverrides                 7.7.0\npackaging                 24.2\npandocfilters             1.5.1\nparso                     0.8.4\npip                       23.0.1\nplatformdirs              4.3.6\nprometheus_client         0.21.1\nprompt_toolkit            3.0.50\npsutil                    7.0.0\npure_eval                 0.2.3\npycparser                 2.22\nPygments                  2.19.1\npython-dateutil           2.9.0.post0\npython-json-logger        3.3.0\npywin32                   310\npywinpty                  2.0.15\nPyYAML                    6.0.2\npyzmq                     26.3.0\nreferencing               0.36.2\nrequests                  2.32.3\nrfc3339-validator         0.1.4\nrfc3986-validator         0.1.1\nrpds-py                   0.23.1\nSend2Trash                1.8.3\nsetuptools                65.5.0\nsix                       1.17.0\nsniffio                   1.3.1\nsoupsieve                 2.6\nstack-data                0.6.3\nterminado                 0.18.1\ntinycss2                  1.4.0\ntomli                     2.2.1\ntornado                   6.4.2\ntraitlets                 5.14.3\ntypes-python-dateutil     2.9.0.20241206\ntyping_extensions         4.12.2\nuri-template              1.3.0\nurllib3                   2.3.0\nwcwidth                   0.2.13\nwebcolors                 24.11.1\nwebencodings              0.5.1\nwebsocket-client          1.8.0\nwidgetsnbextension        4.0.13\n\nI created a Widget with a Single Button in a simple reproducer.

        "body": "Outputs are associated with the request that created them. For normal executions like running code in a cell, this is an `execute_request`. For button click events, this is a `comm_msg` triggered when the widget button is clicked. So since the print output is not associated with a cell execution, there isn't an output area to attach it to and it ends up discarded. That's why the `with out:` works: it explicitly routes messages to an OutputArea.\n\nIt may be that the vs code extension changed how they handle 'unrouted' output (output not associated with an output area). Some frontends choose to display these in some 'default' area, some choose to discard them. Both are valid choices. The vs code extension is not part of Jupyter, so you should problem bring this up over there.\n"

I could only back out the extension in VS Code to validate when the change occurred. These notebooks have been in production for more than four years, and only recently has this output change started to happen. Is there a way to force back to STDOUT?  I hoped setting the print \"file\" argument to sys.stdout would move it back to the cell.\n\nThanks, \nPaul \n\n\n\n"

I'm not sure what package change would have done this. It could be something in `ipykernel` affecting the parent-request association with widget messages.\n\n>  I hoped setting the print \"file\" argument to sys.stdout would move it back to the cell.\n\nIt is going to 'stdout', but setting `file` doesn't specify what it's stdout _of_. What it isn't is stdout _of a cell execution_, so there is no unambiguously appropriate cell output area to send it to. I'm not sure if there's an option in a frontend to send output that's not produced by a cell to a cell's output .\n\nRouting of output messages not produced by cell execution has been handled inconsistently over the years by various frontends, depending on exactly how various components interact.\n\nIf you want to force it back to some cell's output (which one?), you might be able to hook something up with an output widget.\n\nFor example, you can register a specific Output widget to capture all output produced during comm messages not explicitly captured otherwise:\n\n```python\n# create an output area to display detached widget output\ncomm_out = widgets.Output()\ndisplay(comm_out)\n\n# send detatched output created during comm msgs to our output area\nip = get_ipython()\noriginal_comm_msg_handler = ip.kernel.shell_handlers[\"comm_msg\"]\n\n\ndef captured_comm_msg(*args, **kwargs):\n    with comm_out:\n        return original_comm_msg_handler(*args, **kwargs)\n\n\nip.kernel.shell_handlers[\"comm_msg\"] = captured_comm_msg\n```\n"

I got into the habit of clicking the top of the notebook, after which Ctrl-F opens the default browser search functionality, and hoped that the issues in the Jupyter search would eventually be ironed out but now that Jupyter started not rendering the entire notebook by default, it's a serious problem:\r\n\r\n1: The search defaults to not search in cell outputs, which is way too opinionated for as general a shortcut as Ctrl-F. It has certainly never been *my* intent when I pressed Ctrl-F. This default currently even needs changing everytime a notebook is opened. See video above.\r\n\r\n2: The highlighting of search results is broken for cell outputs. See video above.\r\n\r\n3: The rotation of search result highlighting is broken when using the \"up\" button on the search window. See video above.\r\n\r\n4: The latency on even an empty notebook is crazy high. Right here on github, when I use the browser search functionality via Ctrl-F the delay between updating the search term and the new matches being highlighted is non-existent. In a Jupyter notebook, whether I use the Jupyter notebook search window or the standard Browser search window, the delay is close to a second. See video above.\r\n\r\n5: After a cell input match has been highlighted, closing the search bar does not put me into insert mode to let me edit the highlight straight away. See video below for how this should work.\r\n\r\n\r\n## Reproduce\r\n\r\nCreate notebook as in video and start playing around.\r\n\r\n## Expected

I was actually going to submit my own bug report to suggest the addition, but here is a good place.\n\nIf this is a reasonable change, It would be nice to insert it to the project.\n"

I'm creating this post as a user who has tried to embrace JupyterLab but, despite all its great extra features, has always returned to notebook classic. \r\n\r\nThe reason: JupyterLab's keyboard shortcuts different enough that they frustrate many years of muscle memory built up in notebook classic. Sure, I can configure them to what I'm used to, but that means additional work each time I want to set up a (sometimes one-off) Jupyter environment somewhere. \r\n\r\nHaving just tried the Notebook 7 alpha, I can already tell the shortcuts are more like those in JupyterLab. I'm curious, does anyone know why JupyterLab didn't just keep the same shortcuts as before? It's always striked me as such a weird UX decision.\r\n\r\nAs for the question in my title, I'd like to float the idea of reversing that move in Notebook 7. Sooner or later, notebook classic users will be upgrading to notebook 7 without realizing the important changes beneath the surface. Doubtless many of them will be less than excited to learn they need to learn new shortcuts to get their work done faster.\r\n\r\nOr is it just me?</div>\r\n\r\n---\r\n\r\nAdding to the `7.0` milestone so it can be considered before the Notebook 7 final release.",

    "body": "As a part of reviewing the [prerelease of Notebook 7](https://github.com/jupyter/notebook/releases/tag/v7.0.0a6) for accessibility issues, we teamed up to run some manual keyboard navigation tests on [this Notebook 7 binder](https://gist.github.com/jtpio/d368ab89cee5123ecee60683115e15f3).\r\n\r\nMany thanks to @ohrely, @gabalafou, @krassowski, @vidartf, @steff456, and @afshin for authoring this review!\r\n\r\nPlease note that this format of reporting the full review via issue is new and possibly a little messy. Please let me know if there's anything that would make it easier to understand or manage. Thanks!\r\n\r\n## Takeaways\r\n\r\nBased on the full review, I'm going to briefly issues that stood out.\r\n\r\n### Content order\r\n\r\nIn the file browser\r\n- [ ] The full order of the content isn't clear because of limited visible focus styling.\r\n- [ ] There are unknown focus areas where the user needs to use the tab key multiple times in a row to continue to the next section without visual feedback where they are. We're not sure if this will be solved by visible focus styling or if they content order is jumping somewhere we don't expect.\r\n- [ ] Files tabs, Running tabs, and File sorting UI (like Name and Last Modified ordering) are skipped over with keyboard navigation.\r\n\r\n### Areas to navigate\r\n\r\n- [ ] Navigating through the menu bar with a keyboard \"leaves incorrect `lm-mod-active` class on last active item\"\r\n- [ ] Notebook toolbar excess items cannot be navigated to with a keyboard\r\n- [ ] Leaving the active file editor with a keyboard must be done with the `esc` key. This isn't standard keyboard navigation behavior.\r\n- [ ] JupyterLab cannot switch between split areas https://github.com/jupyterlab/jupyterlab/issues/4407\r\n\r\n### Keyboard/tab traps\r\n\r\n- [ ] Terminal is a major tab trap. Could only escape by using the command palette shortcut.\r\n- [ ] Notebook editor (like other file editors) and consoles must be exited with the `esc` key. This isn't standard keyboard navigation behavior.\r\n- [ ] Could not open new terminal with the Running tab using the keyboard. Only expands and collapses.\r\n- [ ] \"If I hide the header (command palette, untoggle \"Show Header\"), I still tab through the hidden element?\"\r\n- [ ] \"Please check focus reset after Command Palette -> Find... -> Escape to exit out. I would expect focus to go back where I was prior to the command palette (e.g. in a specific cell editor).\"\r\n\r\n### Skip links\r\n\r\n- [x] There does not appear to be a skip link in either the file tree page or the notebook page. There should be skip link(s) to skip over menu bar(s), straight to main page content\r\n\r\n### Focus\r\n\r\n- [ ] There is visible focus in some areas, but it is not applied throughout. Some areas have blue outlines.\r\n- [ ] Sometimes a user is able to see focus because of an area's hover state, but these areas need a true focus state additionally.\r\n- [ ] \"The behavior of hovering/colors/interactions is not the same doing it by the keyboard than doing it with the mouse.\" Meaning different interactive area states are not always triggered by keyboard focus?\r\n\r\n### Mixed input\r\nIn the file browser\r\n- [ ] \"Could not select/unselect file using only keyboard. Multi-select and unselect is also busted\"\r\n\r\n### Keyboard shortcuts\r\n\r\n- [ ] Shortcuts cannot be turned off\r\n- [ ] Shortcuts cannot be remapped/configured (via the UI)\r\n\r\n## Full review\r\n\r\nThis is the full list of prompts and responses from our review session.\r\n\r\n<details>\r\n### Content order\r\n\r\nWhen accessed via keyboard, the content order is logical. ([WCAG 2.2 Focus order](https://www.w3.org/TR/WCAG22/#focus-order))\r\n\r\n1. From the top of the page, press the Tab key repeatedly until reviewer reaches the end of content.\r\n2. Reviewers will know it is the end because if they press Tab once more their keyboard focus will return to the browser.\r\n3. If the reviewer cannot make it to the end of content, please take note of where the focus gets stuck.\r\n\r\nDoes the content order follow reviewer expectations based on reading the content?\r\nResult: It goes from top to bottom and left to right, which makes sense for an English keyboard. I am able to loop from the end of the document back to the top, so that meets my expectations as well.\r\n\r\nI cannot identify the content order in its entirety because of the lack of visible focus indicator (see below). The content order may make sense, but I cannot tell.\r\n\r\nDoes the content order make sense for interacting with the content?\r\nResult: The content order on the file browser goes as follows: 5 unknowns, File, View, Settings, Help, Share, 3 unknowns, Upload, Refresh the file browser, Filter, File browser (can navigate list of files with arrow keys). This is a reading order that makes sense for the page. The main issues are the \"unknowns\" (where I had to use the tab key that number of times with no visible focus state in order to find myself on an interactive area again) and areas that are missed entirely.\r\n\r\nAre any major content areas missed when navigating via keyboard?\r\nResult: While the whole content order is not entirely clear based on this evaluation, we did notice areas missing in the file browser. Missing areas included\r\n- Files and Running tabs\r\n- File sorting UI (like Name and Last Modified ordering)\r\n\r\nAre any interactive content areas missed when navigating via keyboard?\r\nResult: See above.\r\n\r\nOther notes or recommendations:\r\n\r\n### Areas to navigate\r\n\r\nAll areas of the tool can be accessed using keyboard navigation. ([WCAG 2.2 Keyboard](https://www.w3.org/TR/WCAG22/#keyboard))\r\n\r\n1. Navigate via the Tab key major content areas\r\n2. Use the arrow keys to navigate within major content areas.\r\n\r\n| Area | Able to navigate to the area (yes/no/not applicable) | Able to navigate fully within the area (yes/no/not applicable) | Able to navigate out of the area (yes/no/not applicable) |\r\n|---|---|---|---|\r\n| Menubar | yes | yes | yes but leaves incorrect `lm-mod-active` class on last active item |\r\n| Files or Running panel in tree view | no | - | - |\r\n| New/upload/refresh buttons | yes | yes | yes |\r\n| Searchbar in tree view | yes | yes | yes |\r\n| Breadcrumbs | - | - | - |\r\n| Columns of the file browser | no | - | - |\r\n| File browser | yes | yes | yes |\r\n| Running panel | no | no (only the Shut Down All button) | yes |\r\n| File editor | yes | - | yes (after pressing Esc) |\r\n| Notebook toolbar excess items (see screenshot) | no | yes (after focusing with a click) | yes |\r\n| Notebook cells | yes | yes | yes |\r\n\r\nOther notes by area:\r\n- JupyterLab cannot switch between split areas https://github.com/jupyterlab/jupyterlab/issues/4407\r\n\r\n### Keyboard/tab traps\r\n\r\nWhen navigating via keyboard, there are no areas where keyboard focus can enter but not exit. The focus never gets \"trapped.\" ([WCAG 2.2 No keyboard trap](https://www.w3.org/TR/WCAG22/#no-keyboard-trap))\r\n\r\nFrom the above section (Areas to navigate), please list all areas where the reviewer could not navigate out of using the keyboard. Notes are welcome!\r\n\r\nKeyboard/tab traps:\r\n- terminal seems like a really bad trap. Cannot get out with tab, shift tab, escape key, or Alt + D (shortcut to focus address bar in my browser - Firefox). I can escape by Ctrl + Shift + C (command palette) after which I can tab around again!\r\n- file editor (text file): Cannot escape by using tab or shift + tab, but can escape with \"Escape\" key (after I can tab either forward or backward).\r\n- Notebook editor: Code cell editor: Cannot escape by tab/shift+tab. Can escape with \"Escape\" key, but focus is put somewhere where the next focus item is the cell toolbar of the cell you just escaped, which is earlier in the tab order than the editor itself, so you cannot go past the editor. You can go backwards, but that starts from before the first cell, so it is impossible to tab to a cell in the middle of the notebook.\r\n- Console: Same issue as Notebook editor where using \"Escape\" key to get out of editor will re-trap you when you hit continue tabbing. It does however seem to be the last element on the page, so probably not as bad of a problem.\r\n\r\nOther notes or recommendations:\r\n- Could not figure out how to open a running terminal from the \"running tab\", was only able to expand collapse sections...\r\n- If I hide the header (command palette, untoggle \"Show Header\"), I still tab through the hidden element?\r\n- In the terminal, I was able to tab into the codemirror editor for the previous cells somehow. Some of the things I did was: Turn on \"Show all Kernel actrivity\", enter Zen mode, open the palette and tab further. Somehow I was able to enter the CM editor and insert tabs. See screenshot below.\r\n![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/510760/195416055-8ce1f436-d753-4593-8934-d20145204ff1.png)\r\n- Please check focus reset after Command Palette -> Find... -> Escape to exit out. I would expect focus to go back where I was prior to the command palette (e.g. in a specific cell editor).\r\n\r\n\r\n### Skip links\r\n\r\nWhen using keyboard navigation, there is a link to switch keyboard focus directly to the tool's main content and skip header navigation or repeated content. ([WCAG 2.2 Bypass Blocks](https://www.w3.org/TR/WCAG22/#bypass-blocks))\r\n\r\n1. From the top of the page, press the Tab key. If you have already been interacting with the page, reviewer may need to reload page and then press Tab.\r\n2. Once focus is on the skip link, press Space or Enter to activate it.  \r\n\r\nIs there a skip link?\r\nResult: There does not appear to be one in either the file tree page or the notebook page.  I inspected html source in browser, but quick searches found nothing.\r\n\r\nIs the skip link prompt visible?\r\nResult: No visible prompt on pages tested.\r\n\r\nWhat does the skip link prompt skip?\r\nResult: N/A\r\n\r\nWhere does the skip link prompt move user focus to?\r\nResult: N/A\r\n\r\nDoes the skip link behavior meet reviewer expectations?\r\nResult: No; there should be skip link(s) to skip over menu bar(s), straight to main page content.\r\n\r\nOther notes or recommendations: https://github.com/ offers a basic working example of skip links for comparison.\r\n\r\n### Interactive Areas\r\n\r\nAll buttons, links, form fields, or similar interactive areas can be both accessed and activated using only the keyboard. ([WCAG 2.2 Keyboard](https://www.w3.org/TR/WCAG22/#keyboard))\r\n\r\n1. Navigate via the Tab key to interactive areas. \r\n2. Activate interactive areas using the Enter or Spacebar key.\r\n\r\n| Interactive area | Able to navigate to the area (yes/no/not applicable) | Able to input information (yes/no/not applicable) | Able to activate the area (yes/no/not applicable) |\r\n|---|---|---|---|\r\n| Button 1| a | b | c |\r\n| Button 2| d | e | f |\r\n| Button 3 | g | h | i |\r\n| Link 1 | j | k | l |\r\n| Link 2 | m | n | o |\r\n| Form field 1 | p | q | r |\r\n| Add table rows as needed! |  |  |  |\r\n| |  |  |  |\r\n\r\nOther notes by area:\r\n\r\n### Focus\r\n\r\nThere is a visible focus state for all content. It appears by default when navigating via keyboard. ([WCAG 2.2 Focus visible](https://www.w3.org/TR/WCAG22/#focus-visible))\r\n\r\n1. From the top of the page, press the Tab key repeatedly until reviewer reaches the end of content. \r\n\r\nResult: pressing the Tab key repeatedly moves the focus around the interface, but it doesn't give focus to all the elements of the UI. There's no focus to the sidebars items, though items inside the opened sidebar are getting focus.\r\n2. If end of content cannot be reached, the reviewer may report on what they could interact with.\r\n\r\nResult: The end content can be reached, and it will circle back to the starting point of the document.\r\n3. If the reviewer is comfortable, they may also use the browser inspector to select an area and toggle focus per area.\r\n\r\nIs there visible focus styling? If so, please briefly describe it.\r\nResult: \r\n\r\n- Jupyterlab main areas have a blue margin for the sidebar contents and links inside the notebook. \r\n- Jupyterlab main menu has a hover color over the menu that is focused.\r\n- The user is not able to change the files, and there's no way to have a visible way to see which one is selected. (When done with the mouse it does have a hover color)\r\n- The menubar for the notebook has a hover color on the focused item.\r\n\r\nIs the focus styling consistent throughout?\r\nResult:\r\n\r\n- In the menus, sidebar, lists and tree views it is pretty consistent. It has the same hover color and behavior throughout the interface\r\n- The main content areas are not consistent in the blue margin, some items in the menus inside the sidebars have it,\r\n<img width=\"602\" alt=\"image\" src=\"https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/20992645/195414449-3d1f3651-74e0-402f-963f-2ce4a4614bbf.png\">\r\n- The behavior of hovering/colors/interactions is not the same doing it by the keyboard than doing it with the mouse.\r\n- There's a dialog that appears to go to the left sidebar, but I couldn't use it\r\n\r\nAre there any areas without visible focus styling?\r\nResult: The change from sidebar to the notebook and afterwards is tricky because there's no visible focus styling.\r\n\r\nWas the reviewer ever unclear about where their keyboard focus was during the review? If so, please note where or why.\r\nResult:\r\n\r\nSome items are not focused because the user will not be able to make any action, but it makes the interaction weird. For example, the only item that you are able to get focus in the status bar is the first one (which is the only one that has an action associated). Also the focus changes in the different type of documents that you can open in the main content area.\r\n\r\nOther notes or recommendations:\r\n\r\n### Mixed input\r\n\r\nIt is possible to complete tasks while switching between input mechanisms, for example using a keyboard and mouse and touch screen. ([WCAG 2.2 Concurrent input mechanisms](https://www.w3.org/TR/WCAG22/#concurrent-input-mechanisms))\r\n\r\n1. Locate an interactive area.\r\n2. Complete the interaction using keyboard controls.\r\n3. Complete the interaction using the mouse.\r\n4. Complete the interaction using touch controls.\r\n5. If the task has multiple steps, the reviewer can try using a different interaction for each step.\r\n6. Repeat as needed across interactive areas.\r\n\r\n- I only covered the first page of Notebook 7 (the one with the two tabs, Files and Running). I did not look into any open notebook files or other documents or parts of the UI.\r\n- Need to do this part of the audit with an actual touch device and not just a simulator. My hope was that I could use the iOS simulator to audit the UI for touch interactions. But I was very surprised when I opened the iPad Air simulator today. It's been a while since I used the iPad simulator. I'm not sure, but I think that in the past the UX made it a bit more obvious that touch events were being simulated. What I remember is that in the past when you dragged your mouse over the simulator window, the mouse pointer icon changed from an arrow icon to a round circle. So I just wasn't sure if I was sending touch events or not. I noticed an option under I/O > Input > Send Pointer to Device. Documentation isn't great. I noticed that when I activate \"Send Pointer to Device\" then the Notebook UI is aware of where the pointer is (e.g., menus in the top menu bar open when I hover over them). So my guess is that \"Send Pointer to Device\" is to simulate when you connect an external mouse to the iPad (or use it as a second screen). But the overall takeaway for me is that next time I need to use an actual touch device rather than a simulator, because otherwise there's too much guesswork about what the simulator is actually doing.\r\n- One bizarre thing I noticed is that when I turned on \"Send Pointer to Device,\" I was unable to click between the `Files` and `Running` tabs.\r\n- I could also not find a way to switch between those tabs using only the keyboard.\r\n- I could not find a way to use the keyboard for: select all files, sort files by name, sort files by last modified.\r\n- Could not select/unselect file using only keyboard. Multi-select and unselect is also busted. \r\n- Can shutdown kernels from Running using only keyboard.\r\n- Can expand/collapse sections under Running using only keyboard.\r\n\r\n#### Task name + region\r\n\r\nDoes the task have multiple steps?

On a separate note, we are aware of the work that @gabalafou has already done on fixing the tab traps in the JupyterLab repository at https://github.com/jupyterlab/jupyterlab/pull/14115. If this PR has not been merged when we start working on this assignment, it will definitely be a priority to help get this work integrated in JupyterLab (review, debugging, etc).\r\n\r\nUpon finishing this assignment, we would love to connect with you on the possibility of writing a joint blog post showing progress on these subjects, the multi-stakeholder effort on accessibility, and crediting the audit done by Isabela.\r\n"

Before you do, let's make sure this is the right place to post your question/issue.\r\n\r\nJupyter Notebook 6.x development is in maintenance-only mode. Bugs found in Notebook 6.x and that don't reproduce in Notebook 7.x may not get fixed.\r\n\r\nWork in this repository is focused on Jupyter Notebook 7.x, the former RetroLab project. The code base for Notebook 7.x is very different than Notebook 6.x. If you can, please try reproducing Notebook 6.x bugs with Notebook 7.x using the main branch of this repository.\r\n\r\nWe recommend that you check out JupyterLab (https://github.com/jupyterlab/jupyterlab), Jupyter's next generation Notebook interface.\r\n\r\nHere, we're looking for specific bugs in the Jupyter Notebook codebase. If you think you've identified such a bug, you can continue opening your issue here. We'd appreciate if you include as much detail as possible, such as links to the offending code, snapshots of the UI issue, code blocks with your console logs, etc.\r\n\r\nIf you're having issues installing Jupyter Notebook, or you're having another issue and don't know how to proceed, try the following:\r\n\r\n1. scan the \"What to do when things go wrong\" (https://jupyter-notebook.readthedocs.io/en/stable/troubleshooting.html#what-to-do-when-things-go-wrong) page in our documentation to see if your question has already been answered\r\n\r\n2. post your question on the Jupyter Notebook discourse channel (https://discourse.jupyter.org/c/notebook/31). There are many more people in the Jupyter community that engage on that channel.\r\n   -->\r\n\r\n**Describe the feature**\r\n\r\nIn notebook up to v6, there is a feature to trigger various tools on top of the cells:\r\n\r\n![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/8435071/166728981-46828017-81b3-4ab3-afb2-cbaa2d4a3a19.png)\r\n\r\nThis kind of feature is not available on JupyterLab. In [external extension](https://github.com/jupyterlab-contrib/jlab-enhanced-cell-toolbar), I started introducing a similar feature (not yet publish):\r\n\r\n![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/8435071/166729300-f10a1826-434c-4285-8e3b-09771e02d270.png)\r\n\r\nTwo questions arise from this work and discussion at the Notebook and JupyterLab meetings:\r\n- What to do in notebook v7?\r\n- Where the code for that feature should live\r\n  - Creating a new project in the JupyterLab organization\r\n  - Creating a new package in the JupyterLab repository focusing on those _cell editors_",

A few additional comments, some from the weekly meeting Zoom chat:\r\n\r\n* The classic notebook only shows a single cell metadata editor at a time (I had mis-remembered that). To maintain the simplicity and document oriented nature of notebook v7, I think this is important UX feature to preserve from the classic notebook (rather than showing multiple cell editors at a time).\r\n* One of the main usability issues with the classic notebook cell tagging is that you always have to retype the tag name, even when you have applied the same tag to other cells. We fixed that in JupyterLab, where you see the tags applied to other cells and can quickly apply them to the current cell with a click. I don't think we should lose the usability improvement in notebook v7, even if notebook v7 has the metadata editors above the cell.\r\n* I think we have an opportunity to improve the visual design of this and that could help in ensuring it doesn't disrupt the document oriented feel.\r\n* I don't see why we wouldn't also ship this with JupyterLab to ensure users can go back and forth seamlessly."

Multi-file operations are possible with modifier keys, but that UX is less discoverable than visible checkboxes, and may pose challenges on mobile devices or other scenarios. It also may present accessibility barriers that the checkbox solves. This should also include the top checkbox with a drop menu.\r\n* The breadcrumbs in Retro should be clickable for navigation, as in Classic.\r\n* The Retro browser should show file size.\r\n* This one is controversial enough (I'm not even 100% sure it's the right thing to do) that I'll open a separate issue for it so it can be discussed on its merits: switch the retro browser to acting on single rather than double clicks...\r\n\r\nThis list is just a start from a  quick review, but overall having as close UX parity as possible in retro would help us tremendously in considering the move of our courses to Retro.\r\n\r\nThanks!!",

Also this issue is more about targeting simple use cases, such as `otter-grader` executing code like `display(Javascript(\"Jupyter.notebook.save_checkpoint();\"))`, rather than complex extensions like nbgrader or RISE (for those it would be better to do a proper port). We don't need to cover the whole `Jupyter.notebook` API if it's not necessary.\r\n\r\n> I also wonder what this does to the JupyterLab extension ecosystem? Would folk have to add tags to show whether their extension works only in JupyterLab, only in RetroLab, or in both?\r\n\r\nWe should still actively encourage developers to make JupyterLab extensions as this is the way forward. As discussed in other places, the tooling around authoring JupyterLab extensions can still be improved so it's more welcoming to non-developers. Folks should not start making new extensions relying on `IPython` / `Jupyter`. Actually if we add them to retro we could mark them as deprecated from the start. Because they will just be available to help with the transition.\r\n\r\n> And I wonder if these API _can_ be exposed, why were they not exposed from the start? Or if they were, why were they withdrawn? What architectural or security principles are JupyterLab puritans being asked to give up by exposing these APIs?! ;-)\r\n\r\nFor several reasons I would say. Having `Jupyter.notebook` exposed on `window` is quite of a strong assumption specific to classic. In JupyterLab there might not even be a notebook displayed on the page."

    "body": "## Description\r\n\r\nI just upgraded to jupyter notebook 7.0, thus migrating from the \"classic\" experience to the \"jupyterlab\" based version. With that migration, my user-experience has degraded significantly. I have a notebook that hosts a number of weakly related interactive tasks that I run sporadically while exploring a problem. The output from some of these cells can sometimes be 100s of lines long. In general, that output being collapsed is great, but while a specific task is running, I want to be able to use the full screen real-estate to monitor the (long-running) task as it goes. Previously, I would un-collapse the output after it started, and then be able to just follow the output, as it is generated. Now, if I attempt to do that, after a several seconds and potentially hundreds of lines of output later, it auto-collapses again. All of a sudden, this leaves me (who followed the output in the uncollapsed state) in the middle of nowhere far away in that document. It appears, previously (Notebook v 6.x), it would only auto-collapse once per execution, but now it does it repeatedly. \r\n\r\n(I have been directed here from the JupyterLab repo, where I reported the same issue: https://github.com/jupyterlab/jupyterlab/issues/11760 )\r\n\r\n## Reproduce\r\n\r\n 1. Execute a cell containing long-running code that continuously produces output, such as the following:\r\n ```python\r\nimport time\r\n\r\nfor k in range(10):\r\n    print(\"\\n\".join(f\"- {k}.{v}\" for v in range(100 if not k else 20)))\r\n    time.sleep(5)\r\n ```\r\n 2. Try keep the output area expanded and follow the output at it generates. It will constantly collapse away under your nose. If there is a lot of cells/output following the currently executing cell, you'll have a hard time getting back to that output.\r\n\r\n## Expected behavior\r\n\r\nThe output area should stay uncollapsed while I'm following the output.\r\n\r\n## Context\r\n\r\n<!--Complete the following for context, and add any other relevant context-->\r\n\r\n- Operating System and version: macOS 13.4\r\n- Browser and version: Chome Version 115.0.5790.114 (Official Build) (arm64)\r\n- Jupyter Notebook version: 7.0.2\r\n\r\n## Screencast\r\nBoth examples show the same notebook executed in two different versions of jupyter notebook.\r\nI have added one cell above and below each containing dummy output (`(pre-fill)` and `(post-fill)`) to highlight the user experience if that happens in the middle of a long notebook.\r\n\r\n### Version 7.0.2\r\nhttps://github.com/jupyter/notebook/assets/1310437/c1efb6d1-bff0-4991-b353-bad2a1bda4f5\r\n### Version 6.5.5\r\nhttps://github.com/jupyter/notebook/assets/1310437/9ea55510-e027-4681-aa38-d492b854c3db\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n",

Bugs found in Notebook 6.x and that don't reproduce in Notebook 7.x may not get fixed.\r\n\r\nWork in this repository is focused on Jupyter Notebook 7.x, the former RetroLab project. The code base for Notebook 7.x is very different than Notebook 6.x. If you can, please try reproducing Notebook 6.x bugs with Notebook 7.x using the main branch of this repository.\r\n\r\nWe recommend that you check out JupyterLab (https://github.com/jupyterlab/jupyterlab), Jupyter's next generation Notebook interface.\r\n\r\nHere, we're looking for specific bugs in the Jupyter Notebook codebase. If you think you've identified such a bug, you can continue opening your issue here. We'd appreciate if you include as much detail as possible, such as links to the offending code, snapshots of the UI issue, code blocks with your console logs, etc.\r\n\r\nIf you're having issues installing Jupyter Notebook, or you're having another issue and don't know how to proceed, try the following:\r\n\r\n1. scan the \"What to do when things go wrong\" (https://jupyter-notebook.readthedocs.io/en/stable/troubleshooting.html#what-to-do-when-things-go-wrong) page in our documentation to see if your question has already been answered\r\n\r\n2. post your question on the Jupyter Notebook discourse channel (https://discourse.jupyter.org/c/notebook/31).

Same `A- on dark theme`\r\n**Ambulatory** - mostly usable, just a few blockers for supplementary actions. `Grade B`\r\n**Deaf/Hard of Hearing** - completely supported. `Grade A+`\r\n**Cognitive** - completely supported. `Grade A+`\r\n**Seizures** - completely supported. `Grade A+`\r\n\r\nRelated to https://github.com/jupyterlab/jupyterlab/issues/9399 but `NotebookV7` obviously much better and what should be recommended to persons with disabilities and just needs a few small fixes to be fully supporting of Low Vision, Color Blind, and Ambulatory users.\r\n\r\n## Issues \r\n- [x] #6924\r\n- [ ] #6948\r\n- [ ] #6928\r\n- [ ] #6926\r\n- [x] #6927\r\n- [ ] On focus and hover on the notebook title on just the dark theme, this needs a more distinct color change. As is (change from dark gray to lighter gray) is not enough of a difference to visually demonstrate it's currently focused/it does something.\r\n- [x] https://github.com/jupyterlab/jupyterlab/pull/14597\r\n- [x] #6957\r\n- [ ] #6925\r\n- [ ] #6931\r\n- [ ] Hovering over something with a hoverable popup/tooltip does not let you dismiss it with the ESC key.\r\n- [ ] #6947\r\n- [x] Minor dark theme color contrast fix on \"About Jupyter Notebook\" modal.\r\n- [ ] #6929\r\n- [ ] #6932\r\n- [ ] #6930\r\n\r\n## Issues (Broken Down)\r\n### Language\r\n- **Expectation**: Language tags are specified on `<html>` element based on the language the content is being displayed as. If content is in English, needs to be `<html lang=\"en\">`, etc. (WCAG Criteria 3.1.1 (A) and 3.1.2 (AA))\r\n- **Observed**:\r\n  - On all pages with my language set to English, `lang=\"default\"` which reads my content in GERMAN (probably looking at the first 2 letters \"de\"). Need to have JS that powers this instead change to the proper lang codes.\r\n  - If importing over the Settings Editor to Notebookv7 ever, recommend adding dropdown menu for languages so user only selects from list of languages that are currently supported/installed so bilingual blind users can easily toggle without fear of messing up.\r\n\r\n### Focus\r\n**Issue Area # 1**\r\n- **Expectation**: All supplementary elements that a user needs to interact with receive keyboard focus and be reached using only the keyboard. (WCAG Criteria 2.1.1 (A))\r\n- **Observed**:\r\n  - On new markdown and terminal pages, these don't let you escape the content body to do other things once you get inside of it.\r\n  - On Tree page, can't get to \"Running\" tab with just a keyboard. That section or each of those tabs need a tabindex=\"0\" on it.\r\n  - Keyboard user cannot tab to the notebook title to trigger the modal to edit the notebook title. Needs tabindex=\"0\" on it.\r\n\r\n**Issue Area # 2**\r\n- **Expectation**: All supplementary elements that a user needs to interact with receive keyboard focus and be reached using only the keyboard. (WCAG Criteria 2.1.1 (A))\r\n- **Observed**:\r\n  - On both light and dark theme, when focused on the Jupyter logo in header, the focus indicator is just a vertical line on the left side. This is not sufficient and needs to either surround the logo or the logo needs to be visually and noticably altered.\r\n  - Assuming functionality is added to allow keyboard-only users to tab to the notebook title to trigger the modal to edit notebook titles, this focus on dark theme needs to be more visually different. THe change from dark gray to lighter gray is not enough. Make sure difference is a difference in 3.0:1 contract ratio from non-hover to hover.\r\n\r\n### Content, Organization, and Navigation\r\n**Issue Area # 1**\r\n- **Expectation**: The user can skip navigation functions, sidebar, or other repetitive content go straight to the content. (WCAG Criteria 2.4.1 (A))\r\n- **Observed**: User is forced to tab 20 times every time on notebook page because getting to the main region (and slightly less times on the other non-notebook pages). Needs a skip link to appear in first tab or two to jump straight to `#main`\r\n\r\n**Issue Area # 2**\r\n- **Expectation**: Tables used appropriately, clearly organized, and labeled. (WCAG Criteria 1.3.1 (A) & 4.1.2 (A))\r\n- **Observed**:  Main table (tree page) is not a real table; it is made of `<div>`s within `<div>`s not Table > THEAD/TBODY > TR > TH/TD. Without this blind users/screen readers cannot decipher that this is row data or what element corresponds to what row, how many rows there are, etc.\r\n\r\n**Issue Area # 3**\r\n- **Expectation**: Is content that appears on hover or keyboard focus dismissible, hovberable, and persistent? (WCAG Criteria 1.4.13 (AA))\r\n- **Observed**:\r\n  - All hoverables (tooltips) are not appearing on keyboard focus based on what I could tell. AKA, people using only keyboard do not know that the play button in the heading has meaning \"Run the selected cells (Shift + Enter)\". They just have to guess what all of these buttons do. Once implemented, make sure these users can dismiss these hoverables by pressing the ESC key.\r\n\r\n**Issue Area # 4**\r\n- **Expectation**: User is informed when content changes dynamically away from the focus (WCAG Criteria 3.2.2 (A), 4.1.2 (A), & 4.1.3 (AA))\r\n- **Observed**: On notebook page when preforming all code cell actions (runs, stops, moves, duplications, etc.) it's not mentioning this to screenreaders. On move it should send a screenreader only alert saying ex. \"Code cell number 4 has swapped with code cell 3 successfully\" or at minimum \"cell move successful\". Whenever a cell is run, I expect it to say ex. \"Running cell 3\", say the output as it's happening, example \"Packages already installed: pandas\", etc. then will read either \"Cell 3 finished successfully\" or \"Cell 3 failed. Error: {insert error}.\r\n\r\n### Color, Contrast, and Zoom\r\n**Issue Area # 1**\r\n- **Expectation**:  Do the default text and background size and colors provide sufficient contrast? (WCAG Criteria 1.4.3 (AA))\r\n- **Observed**: \r\n  - On just dark theme, the links found on the \"About Jupyter Notebook\" dropdown have insufficient contrast. Needs a 4.5:1 ratio or higher but has a 1.71 ratio (dark blue on dark gray). When selecting this link as well it becomes a dark red on red (1.64 contrast ratio).\r\n  - On both dark and light themes, the colors found within the code blocks (the syntax highlighting) needs 4 and 6 color changes respectively. Both of these need to reach a 4.5:1 contrast ratio between and its background.These also ideally need to have a certain contrast (3:1) between one another so they stand out (a different WCAG requirement), but there are too many colors used that all may appear adjacent to one another that this does not seem  possible so can ignore. I recognize this might be a different codebase but wanted to flag at least.\r\n\r\n**Issue Area # 2**\r\n- **Expectation**: Can the page be zoomed to 400% zoom in a 1280px wide display without requiring two scroll bars? (WCAG Criteria 1.4.10 (AA)).\r\n- **Observed**: \r\n  - Notebook page at 400% magnification cannot see the notebook title, the language of the notebook, the jupyter link to go back, or the help dropdown. In addition the \"Not Trusted\" block is partially cut off when appearing (also can't edit the title of the notebook but revealing it will most likely fix this).\r\n  -  Minor annoyance on /tree page. The top 2/3rds of the page is fixed so you can only see 1-2 notebooks from list as you scroll. Recommend making most (everything below the main header) if not all of it static to maximize scrollable area.",

However, _many_ people are still using and developing on the v6 notebook setup. This is particularly challenging for people building _extensions_ that depend on APIs that will soon be removed. For example, I recently found out that a large university started building a custom grading UI on top of the v6 notebook UI, because they didn't realize it was going to be switched to JupyterLab.\r\n\r\n### Proposal\r\n\r\nI suggest that we add a large **‼️ DEPRECATION** to any of the current documentation pages that discuss extension APIs that will be deprecated. For example, [the front-end interface page](https://jupyter-notebook.readthedocs.io/en/stable/extending/frontend_extensions.html).

Puedes comprobarlo ejecutando:\n\nintento\n\nCopiar\npython --version\nen el entorno que vayas a usar.\n\nRevisado variables de entorno:\nComprueba que no tengas variables definidas como PYTHONPATHo PYTHONHOMEque puedan estar apuntando a la instalación de Python 3.8.3.\n\nUtilizar entornos virtuales:\nEs recomendable crear un entorno virtual específico para Python 3.13.0. Por ejemplo:\n\nintento\n\nCopiar\npython3.13 -m venv ~/venv/py13\nsource ~/venv/py13/bin/activate  # En Linux/Mac\no el equivalente en Windows. Esto garantiza que los paquetes y configuraciones se mantendrán aislados.\n\n2. Instalar y configurar Jupyter e ipykernel en Python 3.13.0\nInstalar los paquetes necesarios:\nUna vez activado el entorno de Python 3.13.0, instala Jupyter y el kernel:\n\nintento\n\nCopiar\npip install --upgrade pip\npip install jupyter ipykernel\nRegistrar el kernel:\nRegistre el kernel para que Jupyter reconozca la instalación de Python 3.13.0:\n\nintento\n\nCopiar\npython -m ipykernel install --user --name python-3.13 --display-name \"Python 3.13.0\"\nEsto crea un archivo kernel.json(normalmente en ~/.local/share/jupyter/kernels/python-3.13/) que debe apuntar al ejecutable correcto.\n\nVerifique el contenido del kernel.json:\nAbra el archivo y asegúrese de que en la lista \"argv\"aparezca la ruta al ejecutable de Python 3.13.0, sin referencias a la instalación de Python 3.8.3.\n\n3. Iniciar Jupyter Notebook de Forma Aislada\nDesde el entorno correcto:\nInicia Jupyter Notebook desde el entorno virtual de Python 3.13.0:\n\nintento\n\nCopiar\njupyter notebook\nEsto ayudará a que las extensiones y configuraciones utilicen la versión adecuada.\n\nSelecciona el kernel adecuado:\nAl crear un nuevo notebook, asegúrate de seleccionar el kernel \"Python 3.13.0\" que acabas de registrar.\n\n4. Resolver Problemas con Extensiones y Archivos Estáticos\nExtensiones de widgets:\nLos errores 404 que hacen referencia a /nbextensions/widgets/notebook/js/extension.jsindican que puede faltar la extensión de ipywidgets. Para instalarla y habilitarla, ejecuta:\n\nintento\n\nCopiar\npip install ipywidgets\njupyter nbextension enable --py widgetsnbextension\nBootstrap-tour:\nLos errores 404 sobre bootstrap-tour.min.csssugieren que alguna extensión o configuración de Jupyter está intentando cargar este recurso. Considere lo siguiente:\n\nSi usa alguna extensión que requiera bootstrap-tour , verifique la documentación para instalar correctamente sus dependencias.\nSi no necesitas esa funcionalidad, revisa la configuración de Jupyter o deshabilita la extensión que la solicita.\n5. Limpiar Cachés y Revisar Configuraciones Residuales\nLimpieza de configuraciones:\nPuede existir configuración residual en rutas de Jupyter que apunten a la instalación antigua. Revisa las rutas de configuración con:\n\nintento\n\nCopiar\njupyter --paths\ny, si es necesario, limpie o corrija las configuraciones que puedan causar conflictos.\n\nModo Debug:\nPara obtener más detalles sobre errores al iniciar Jupyter, puedes lanzarlo en modo debug:\n\nintento\n\nCopiar\njupyter notebook --debug\nEsto te ayudará a identificar otros posibles problemas o conflictos.\n\n6. Actualizaciones y Compatibilidad\nActualiza Jupyter e ipykernel:\nDado que Python 3.13.0 es una versión más reciente, es posible que algunas dependencias o extensiones necesiten versiones actualizadas para ser totalmente compatibles. Revisa y actualiza los paquetes involucrados:\n\nintento\n\nCopiar\npip install --upgrade jupyter ipykernel\nRevisa la documentación:\nConsulta la documentación oficial de [Jupyter](https://jupyter.org/) y [ipywidgets](https://ipywidgets.readthedocs.io/) para confirmar si existen pasos específicos o problemas conocidos al usar Python 3.13.0.\n\nResumen Final\nEl problema se origina por una mezcla de configuraciones y rutas de diferentes instalaciones de Python. Para solucionarlo:\n\nAísla el entorno de Python 3.13.0 mediante entornos virtuales y asegurándote de que las variables de entorno no punten a la versión 3.8.3.\nInstale y registre correctamente el kernel de Python 3.13.0 para que el archivo kernel.jsonapunte al ejecutable correcto.\nInicie Jupyter Notebook desde el entorno adecuado y verifique que las extensiones necesarias (como ipywidgets y aquellas que usan bootstrap-tour) estén instaladas y configuradas.\nLimpie los ajustes residuales y actualice los paquetes para garantizar la compatibilidad con Python 3.13.0.\nCon estos pasos, deberías poder evitar la mezcla de librerías y resolver el error de importación en _bootstrap_external."

This could be implemented as a simple notebook magic command (e.g., %reload my_module) that would ensure the module is reloaded from disk, reflecting any changes made. This command should handle the re-import and refresh of the module in a way that ensures consistency across the notebook, providing a seamless development experience.\r\n\r\n\r\n### Additional context\r\n\r\n<!-- Add any other context or screenshots about the feature request here.

This limitation stems from Python's module caching mechanism, which doesn't automatically refresh imported modules after they're modified. Other development environments, such as Visual Studio Code and PyCharm, offer solutions like manual reload commands or automatic \"reload on save\" features for certain applications, significantly enhancing developer efficiency. By enabling similar functionality in Jupyter Notebook, we can streamline the development process, making it more efficient and aligned with modern coding practices.\r\n\r\n\r\n",

Our styles are written in a series of `less` files, which are then compiled to CSS, pulling in pieces from third party sources.\r\n\r\nYou can probably set a permanent override in `~/.jupyter/custom/custom.css`. You might need a `!important` on it to force it to take precedence over other rules. The `!important` tag is a blunt instrument in CSS terms, so it might mess something else up a bit.\r\n\r\nI'm not sure what the best default is here. For wrappable text, it's generally agreed that you want to limit the maximum width, because it's hard to read very long lines. E.g. Github issues is only taking ~1/3 the width of my screen for this comment, even on a laptop. But I can see that for things like large tables this is frustrating."

These HTML comments will not render in the issue, but you can delete them once you've read them if you prefer! -->\n\n<!--\nRight now, you're opening an issue to report a bug in Jupyter Notebook.\n\nPlease answer the following questions for yourself before submitting an issue\n- [ ] I checked the documentation and found no answer\n- [ ] I checked to make sure that this issue has not already been filed\n- [ ] I'm reporting the issue to the correct repository\n\nIf you have further questions after reading below, please visit the Jupyter Notebook discourse channel (https://discourse.jupyter.org/) and submit your questions there. There are many more people in the Jupyter community that engage on that channel.\n\nNOTE:\nJupyter Notebook 6.x development is in maintenance-only mode. Bugs found in Notebook 6.x and that don't reproduce in Notebook 7.x may not get fixed.\n\nWork in this repository is focused on Jupyter Notebook 7.x, the former RetroLab project. The code base for Notebook 7.x is very different than Notebook 6.x. If you can, please try reproducing Notebook 6.x bugs with Notebook 7.x using the main branch of this repository.\n\nWe recommend that you check out JupyterLab (https://github.com/jupyterlab/jupyterlab), Jupyter's next generation Notebook interface.\n\nHere, we're looking for specific bugs in the Jupyter Notebook codebase. If you think you've identified such a bug, you can continue opening your issue here. We'd appreciate if you include as much detail as possible, such as links to the offending code, snapshots of the UI issue, code blocks with your console logs, etc.\n-->\n\n## Description\n\nWhen saving or autosaving a file, if the save is kicked off, then the file is edited before the save completes, the system believes the file is saved (you can close the file with no warnings), however the latest edits are not saved.\nThis is quite a rare condition when saving normally, but I managed to reproduce easily in jupyterlab with autosave turned down.\n\nThis means that you could close a file, believing it is up to date, only to find that it has not been fully saved.\n\nThe impact should be quite low to users because:\n\n1. You need to be editing a file during a save operation, then close the file without further edits\n2. Unless copy/pasting, you should at most lose a few characters unless your system is under heavy CPU load\n\nWhile being a small bug, it could have big implications for things like: https://github.com/jupyterlab/jupyterlab/issues/16892\n\nI also had a look at some other issues, and it may possibly be related to this: https://github.com/jupyter/notebook/issues/6184\n\n## Reproduce\n\nFirst identified in jupyter lab, however as per their bug report process, ended up reproducing it on jupyter notebook directly.\nI managed to reproduce it in jupyter lab without imposing any artificial CPU load, however it's very hard to reproduce it without the load in jupyter notebook.\n\nDockerfile:\n\n```\nFROM python:3\nRUN pip install jupyter\nCMD [\"jupyter\", \"notebook\", \"--ServerApp.allow_origin='*'\", \"--ServerApp.token=''\", \"--allow-root\", \"--ServerApp.ip=0.0.0.0\", \"--ServerApp.port=8888\"]\n```\n\nTest.sh (executable):\n\n```\n#!/usr/bin/env bash\ndocker build . -tlabi\ndocker rm -f labc\ndocker run -d -p 8888:8888 --name labc labi\n\necho \"Now:\n- open http://localhost:8888/\n- Create a new python file (add some content and save it)\n- Now press enter to limit the CPU of this box to make the bug more visible...\n\"\nread\ndocker update --cpus 0.01 labc\necho \"\nCPU limited.\nNow:\n- Type a string of characters into the file (e.g. 123456789). Hit Ctrl+S then quickly add a char or two more.\n- Close the file (you should get no warning of unsaved data)\n- Open the file <-- BUG: Content is not correct and missing some characters\n\nNOTE: close file/open file can just be a reload of the page\n\"\n```\n\nOnce you have the above files setup, you can just run `./test.sh`\n\n### To reproduce in jupyterlab:\n\nDockerfile:\n\n```\nFROM python:3\nRUN pip install jupyterlab\nCMD [\"jupyter\", \"lab\", \"--core-mode\", \"--ServerApp.allow_origin='*'\", \"--ServerApp.token=''\", \"--allow-root\", \"--ServerApp.ip=0.0.0.0\", \"--ServerApp.port=8888\"]\n```\n\ntest.sh;\n\n```\n#!/usr/bin/env bash\ndocker build . -tlabi\ndocker rm -f labc\ndocker run -d -p 8888:8888 --name labc labi\n\necho \"Now:\n- open http://localhost:8888/lab\n- goto settings -> Settings Editor -> Document Manager\n- Ensure Autosave is checked and interval is short (e.g. 3s)\n- Open new python file\n- Now press enter to limit the CPU of this box to make the bug more visible...\n\"\nread\ndocker update --cpus 0.01 labc\necho \"\nCPU limited.\nNow:\n- Slowly type a string of characters into the python files (e.g. 123456789). Stop when autosave kicks in and the modified cirle disappears\n- Close the file\n- Open the file <-- BUG: Content is not correct and missing some characters\n\nNOTE: You can get the same bug if you disable autosave, type the characters, then type Ctrl+S and some more characters until the save icon disappears.\n\"\n```\n\n<!--Describe how you diagnosed the issue. See the guidelines at\nhttps://jupyter-notebook.readthedocs.io/en/latest/troubleshooting.html -->\n\n## Expected behavior\n\nWhen saving a file, the state of the file at save time is known.\n\ne.g.:\n\nIn the examples above, I should be warned about unmodified files before closing as the new content has not actually been saved.\n\n## Context\n\nI've reproduced this in AWS sagemaker, but also locally on this setup:\n\nWIndows 11,\nWSL,\nUbuntu 24.04\nDocker 26.1.3\nJupyter notebook version: 7.3.2\nBrowser version: Chrome 133.0.6943.127 \n\n<details><summary>Troubleshoot

You're using an older version of Notebook (and Lab) since the log message indicating that the notebook server has started is not displaying its version information.  This implies a 5.x or older version of Notebook (probably not a big deal, just pointing it out).\r\n2. Assuming your browser session was also on the same restarted laptop, Lab is persisting session information somewhere.  I don't know where that might be kept, but you might want to be sure all kernel sessions are stopped, all browser tabs are closed, then restart your notebook server (application, not machine).\r\n3. This message implies a mismatch of packages and I would recommend upgrading your Notebook package to the current version.  Note that if you also upgrade Lab to >= 3.x, the underlying server becomes jupyter_server rather that notebook (FYI).\r\n```\r\n/Users/noshinmashayekhi/Library/Python/3.8/lib/python/site-packages/notebook/base/zmqhandlers.py:284: RuntimeWarning: coroutine 'WebSocketHandler.get' was never awaited\r\nsuper(AuthenticatedZMQStreamHandler, self).get(*args, **kwargs)\r\n```"

    "body": "This issue is about how the front end should handle the case when a Comm is opened from the back end (ipython kernel for example) to  a target that is unregistered.\r\n\r\nConsider opening a Comm with the standard code from the wiki with an added `on_close` handler:\r\n\r\n```python\r\nfrom ipykernel.comm import Comm\r\nmy_comm = Comm(target_name='my_comm_target')\r\n@my_comm\r\ndef _close(msg):\r\n    print('Closed')\r\n```\r\n\r\nI would expect that if the `target_name` `my_comm_target` is not registered on the front end that my `_close` callback would be called to indicate that the peer is not connected but this is not the case. The Comm remains open unless closed from the kernel.\r\n\r\n**Note**: The behavior described above is the way the ipython kernel currently handles unregistered targets when a front end comm is opened.\r\n\r\n```javascript\r\ncomm = Jupyter.notebook.kernel.comm_manager.new_comm('my_comm_target');\r\ncomm.on_close((msg) => console.log(msg));\r\n```\r\n\r\nLooking at [services/kernels/comm.js#L84](https://github.com/jupyter/notebook/blob/7dc9439af78dadffcf6070c4b351d2d622f1d36e/notebook/static/services/kernels/comm.js#L84), the `Comm` should be created before looking up the target and if the lookup fails (the `load_class` promise is rejected) the comm should be closed. See [ipykernel/comm/manager.py#L75](https://github.com/ipython/ipykernel/blob/0a6898a153c66e2c2ade8cf3e0f199c102fbf33e/ipykernel/comm/manager.py#L75) for the back end implementation that I would like the front end to mirror.\r\n\r\n",
