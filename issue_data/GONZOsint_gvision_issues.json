        "body": "GitHub Copilot: The error message you provided indicates that there is an issue with the `cv2` module, which is used for computer vision tasks in Python. \r\n\r\nHere are a few things you can try to resolve the issue:\r\n\r\n1. Make sure that OpenCV is installed on your system. You can install it using pip by running the following command in your terminal or command prompt:\r\n\r\n   ```\r\n   pip install opencv-python\r\n   ```\r\n\r\n2. Make sure that you have the correct version of OpenCV installed for your system. You can check the version of OpenCV that is installed by running the following command in your Python interpreter:\r\n\r\n   ```python\r\n   import cv2\r\n   print(cv2.__version__)\r\n   ```\r\n\r\n   If the version number is not what you expect, you may need to uninstall and reinstall OpenCV using the correct version.\r\n\r\n3. Make sure that the `cv2` module is installed in the correct location. Depending on your system and Python installation, the `cv2` module may need to be installed in a specific location. You can try reinstalling OpenCV using the `--target` option to specify the installation location:\r\n\r\n   ```\r\n   pip install opencv-python --target=/path/to/installation/location\r\n   ```\r\n\r\n   Replace `/path/to/installation/location` with the path to the directory where you want to install OpenCV.\r\n\r\nIf none of these solutions work, please provide more information about the error message you are seeing, including the full traceback and any other relevant details."
